#1 go to the directory with the java files

#2 open the command prompt in that folder

#3 type the command: "javac *.java"

#4 then you have two options:
	Option #1 type "java Driver filename.txt"
		this will give you the option of using the command line to enter in the weights and penalties required
	Option #2 type "java Driver filename.txt X X X X X X X X" Where x is the respective weights for Wpref, Wpair, Wminfilled, Wsecdiff
			  pen_coursemin, pen_labsmin, pen_notpaired and pen_section.  Note that each of the X values can be unique and do not need
			  to be the same.
